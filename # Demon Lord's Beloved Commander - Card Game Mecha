# Demon Lord's Beloved Commander - Card Game Mechanics
**Version:** v1.11 – Added Core Target Modes & Standardized Effect Types, ModifyCascade supports negative values  
**Format Inspiration:** Slay the Spire (full refresh mana, no lands) + Commander singleton hybrid.  
**Deck Size:** 60 cards + commander (waifu) in command zone (snappy 5-10 min duels).  
**Goal:** Reduce opponent's life from 40 to 0 (or mill deckout).

## Core Rules
- **Singleton:** No duplicates except "Echo Crystals" (neutral mana ramp, max 4).
- **Starting Life:** 40 each.
- **Starting Hand:** 7 cards.
- **Mulligan:** Once only — shuffle deck, draw 6 cards (no further).
- **Hand Size Limit:** Max 13 cards.
  - **Draw Resolution:** Draw 1 card. Immediately discard down to 13 if exceeded (player chooses which).
  - **End Step Cleanup:** Discard to 13 if >13 from effects (player chooses).
- **Draw:** 1 card/turn (skipped if at 13 pre-draw).
- **Commander Rules:** Waifu in command zone. Recast tax: +2 mana per prior cast (cast to battlefield like creature).
- **Sorcery-Speed Only:** All cards/abilities activate in *your* main phase (no interrupts/counters/stacks).
- **Turn Structure:** 
  1. **Untap** (untap tapped cards/abilities).
  2. **Upkeep** (full mana refresh; cascade triggers; bleed check).
  3. **Draw** (1 card; discard excess immediately if >13).
  4. **Main Phase** (play cards from hand, activate abilities/commander).
  5. **Combat** (targeted blocking).
  6. **End Step** (cleanup; final discard to 13).

## Mana System (Full Refresh – Explosive Starts)
- **Starts at 3 Max:** Every turn refreshes to full current max (UI: orbs fill instantly).
- **Upkeep Refresh:** current_mana = max_mana.
- **Max 10:** Upgrades add +1 permanent (story romance, duel wins, cards).
- **Echo Crystals** (0-cost basics, max 4 in deck): Play → +1 mana this turn only (extra burst). **Cascade:** +0 (neutral, no change).

## Core Target Modes (used by most effects)
| Target Mode              | Description                                      | Common Effects That Use It                     |

## Elemental Cascade Meter (Single Chaining Momentum – Mana Cost Adds)
**Each player has one cascade meter:** Single value (0-10) + current Element (Fire/Holy/Arcane/Nature/Shadow/None). Builds by chaining; switches less punishing via mana cost scaling.

- **Elements (5 Total – Balanced Coverage):**
  | Element  | Vibe                  | Primary Waifu     | Secondary Waifu   |
  |----------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | **Fire** | Damage/sabotage      | Miri             | Chesy            |
  | **Holy** | Heal/removal         | Priestess        | Lyra             |
  | **Arcane**| Draw/control        | Lyra             | Succubus         |
  | **Nature**| Ramp/creatures      | Chesy            | Miri             |
  | **Shadow**| Sac/drain           | Succubus         | Priestess        |

- **Building Cascade (On Play Any Non-Neutral Card):**
  - If card's element **matches current** → cascade += **card's mana cost** (cap at 10).
  - Else → **reset cascade = card's mana cost**, set current = card's element (cheap switches lose less).
  - **0-cost Cascade Cards:** +0 to cascade (payoff only).
  - Neutral (Echo Crystals): No cascade change.
  - **UI:** Single ProgressBar (0-10) + glowing element icon/color.

- **Upkeep Triggers** (Auto-resolve flavor bonuses, tied to current element):
  - E.g., "If current=Nature and cascade >=5, +1 mana." "Convert: Switch to Holy, cascade = current/2 (rounded down)."
  - **Bleed:** If cascade <3, cascade -=1 (min 0; anti-turtle).

- **Spending (Main Phase Only):**
  - **Cascade Cards** (0-mana payoffs): Consume X from *current element* → effect + optional *convert* (e.g., "Consume 5 Fire: Deal 10 damage. Convert: Set current=Holy, cascade=3").
  - **Commander Abilities:** E.g., "Spend 4 cascade: Destroy target creature + gain life equal to spent."

- **Alignment Bonus:** 70%+ deck cards in waifu's prim/sec → +[mana cost / 2] extra cascade on matching chains; -1 recast tax.

## Standardized Effect Types
These are the reusable building blocks for card effects in Godot (parameterized, composable).
