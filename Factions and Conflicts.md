## Conflicts Details
- Demons vs. All: Core threat uniting others loosely.
- Church vs. Kingdom: Tense "allies" in power struggle (church laws vs. kingdom autonomy; amplified by noble politics).
- Beastkin: Internal tribal wars (clan vs. clan) + kingdom border conflicts (raids/discrimination).
- Alchemists Guild: No open wars; opportunistic—steal/attack beastkin for resources. Friction w/ church (magic vs. purity) & kingdom (noble rivalries/sway).
- Rebels: Exploit gaps (e.g., church-kingdom strife) for subversion.
- Ties to Axes: Choices here swing waifu axes (e.g., help beastkin +Chesy honor, but +Clara doubt).
