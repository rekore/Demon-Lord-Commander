DEMON LORD'S BELOVED COMMANDER STORY
PROLOGUE – REVISED DIALOGUE DRAFT (v5)

SCENE 1 – OUTSIDE THE RUINS

Cold wind whips through broken pillars. Church sigils carved into cracked stone. MC walks with two Paladins.

Paladin Captain:
Stay close. Even a low-level demon can shred an ordinary man.

Paladin #2 (whispering, half awed):
… but he’s the Hunter... I fought alongside your father before... he disappeared in the Eastern Ruins years ago. he was a great man.

MC:
*Choice* I know/ I don't remember him/ ...

Paladin #2 (grinning):
Still strange seeing you here. All alone. Carrying that… burden.

Paladin Captain:
He doesn’t carry it lightly. That’s why he’s here he's special. And thats why the Church even allowed him to attempt this mission.

Paladin #2:
Special, huh? what a funny way to say cursed... I wonder do you even knows what your stepping into…

Paladin Captain:
Doesn’t matter. Survive, and he’ll learn. Hunter’s work is dangerous. Survival is everything.

*They approach the ruins. Dust swirls around broken stone arches. The faint glow of the ritual circle can be seen inside.*

SCENE 2 – INSIDE THE RUINS

*Small demon crouches in the center of the circle, chanting faintly. The air hums.*

Paladin #2:
It’s… just standing there. Like it belongs.

Paladin Captain:
Hunters handle this kind of thing. That’s why we brought him.

COMBAT TUTORIAL****

SCENE 3 – RITUAL FRACTURE

MC steps closer, crouching to inspect the circle.

MC:
It’s… doing something.

Paladin #2 (panicking):
Don’t touch it!

*MC accidentally steps into the circle. Light explodes outward violently.*

*Light implodes instead of exploding.*

*The world folds inward.*

*A presence presses from everywhere at once.*

*Voice layered with distant echoes — calm and unnerving.*

Demon Lord:
Ah…

So much closer now.

*Images flash — war, executions, cruelty between humans.*

Demon Lord (almost conversational):
You blame us for the thinning veil.

But it is your atrocities that nourish it.

Every act of hatred is an invitation.

(beat)

*You stand in the doorway and ask who opened it.*

*The presence shifts closer — not violent. Observing.*

*MC groans, overwhelmed, barely conscious.*

SCENE 4 – FOREST AWAKENING / ORB

*MC wakes in an unknown forest, groggy and disoriented. Sunlight filters through leaves. Head pounding.*

*A small floating orb with red eyes appears.*

Orb (soft, coaxing):
Easy… don’t strain yourself. You have been through alot

*MC groans, too weak to respond.*

Orb:
Do you at least remember our deal?

*MC cannot answer.*

Orb (patient, slightly amused):
Mm… not yet. That’s fine. You’ll remember soon enough.

*The orb drifts closer, hovering silently, then something seems to startle it and it vanishes.*

SCENE 5 – NYXELLE ARRIVAL (BUBBLY, CHAOTIC, DEVOTED)

*Leaves rustle. Nyxelle bounces into view, tail swishing, horns tipped with sunlight. She sniffles and flops near him, sniffing his hair and hands.*

SCENE 5: Awakening & Sniffing
Fragment 1-

*MC groggy, half-conscious. Nyxelle flops down beside him, tail twitching.*

Nyxelle:
Hiiii! Master! Ohhh… you smell funny… but nice! Is that… sweat? No, yes, yes… funny-smelly… heehee!

*She pokes his hair, then sniffs his face.*

You are damaged.

That is rude.

Who damaged you?

*She places a hand over his chest. A faint shimmer of magic passes through him.*

MC (through pain):
Why…?

Nyxelle:
Because you are mine.

(beat, correcting herself)

No.

I am yours.

That is better.

You are very broken.

That is not allowed.

*She places both hands over his chest. A shimmer of illusion magic flickers — soft and prismatic.*

Nyxelle (cheerful):
Stay still. I will fix the loud parts.

*MC tries to move but can barely lift his hand.*

Nyxelle (leaning close, whispering happily):
There much queiter now

Did you shrink?

That is interesting.

*He blacks out again.*

*She giggles, then peers at the MC.*

Nyxelle:
Oh yes! Master is… hmm… Master… yes… awake… or… hmm… almost awake!

*MC murmurs a weak, unintelligible question.*

Nyxelle (tilting head, considering):
Did… you… try to speak? Heehee… tiny words, funny words… Master words!

Fragment 2 – Berry Feeding

*Nyxelle finds a bright red berry and hops onto his chest.*

Nyxelle:
Huuungry? Little mouth… hungry mouth… hmm… yes, yes!

*She pops it in her mouth, chews, then gently presses her lips to his, feeding him like a bird would feed a chick.*

Nyxelle (softly, bouncing a little):
Mmm… berry tastes funny… but good… Master tastes… hmm… hmm… nice… yes…

*MC groans weakly.*

Nyxelle:
Heehee… silly Master… berry stuck? No? Good… hmm… clouds are pink today…

Fragment 3 – Forest Observations

*MC half-awake. Nyxelle bounces lightly on her toes, sniffing leaves and shadows.*

Nyxelle:
Ahhh… wind smells like… like… hmm… like old paper and rain… maybe… yes… maybe not… haaa… funny wind!

*She twirls around, tail flicking, suddenly plops beside him again.*

Nyxelle:
Leaves! Why are leaves… not blue? Huh… silly leaves… want to be blue… maybe… maybe green is their secret… secret… shhh…

*MC mumbles “…what…?”*

Nyxelle (leaning over, curious):
Yes! Words! Tiny words… smells like… hmm… ideas? Ideas taste funny too…

Fragment 4 – Random Object Thoughts

*Nyxelle picks up a stick, inspects it.*

Nyxelle:
Hmm… stick… small Master? No… maybe… hmm… stick is too stiff… needs more… bounce… yes…

*She tosses it lightly, then peers at MC.*

Nyxelle:
Did stick do a good job? Huh… yes… maybe yes… maybe…

Fragment 5 – Magic Senses

*She waves her hands in the air, sniffing the unseen patterns of magic.*

Nyxelle:
Ooooh… funny… hmm… magic taste like… like… tingly rainbow-sparkles! Yes… lots of sparkles… heehee… funny sparkles…

*She looks at MC.*

Nyxelle:
Do you taste sparkles too, Master? Or… maybe not… maybe only Nyxelle… hmm…

Fragment 6 – Closing / Whispered Affection

*MC stirs slightly, mumbling faintly: “…who… are you…?”*

Nyxelle (leaning close, flopping beside him):
Because… because… Nyxelle! Master! Always Master!

*She nudges him gently with her nose, humming softly.*

Nyxelle:
Funny… soft… warm… smells like… Master… hmm… Master is bestest… bestest… Master…

*MC drifts back into unconsciousness. Nyxelle curls around him protectively, tail swishing.*

SCENE 6 – ESCAPE

*MC awakens alone. Nyxelle is gone.*

*He slowly gets to his feet, groggy. Leaves crunch underfoot. Sunlight filters through the forest.*

*He does not look back.*

SCENE 7 – KINGDOM GATE

*Days later. MC arrives at the kingdom gate, dirty and exhausted.*

Guard #1:
…Hunter?

Guard #2:
No… can’t be…

Guard #1:
We thought you died in the ruins... Glad to have you back!

*The gates slowly open.*

*Cut to black.*

*Title appears:*
