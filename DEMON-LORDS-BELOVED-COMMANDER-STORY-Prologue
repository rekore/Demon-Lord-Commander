DEMON LORD'S BELOVED COMMANDER
PROLOGUE
SCENE 1 – APPROACH TO THE RUINS
Cold wind lashes shattered pillars etched with faded church sigils. The MC, the Hunter, strides between two paladins, his steps heavy with unspoken weight.
Paladin Captain:
Stay close. Even a runt demon can unmake a man like you.
Paladin #2 (whispering, reverent):
...But he's the Hunter. I fought with your father in the Eastern Ruins years back. Great man... until he vanished.
MC:
[Player Choice: "I know." / "I don't remember him." / ...]
Paladin #2 (grinning tightly):
Still odd, you out here alone. Hauling that burden.
Paladin Captain:
He bears it without breaking. That's why the Church lets him hunt. Special like that.
Paladin #2:
Special. Cute word for cursed. You even know what you're walking into?
Paladin Captain:
Survive it, he'll learn. Hunter's life is survival. Nothing else.
Dust devils swirl as they near the crumbling arches. A sickly glow pulses from within.
SCENE 2 – THE RITUAL CIRCLE
A scrawny demon hunkers at the circle's heart, murmuring in tongues. The air thrums like a struck wire.
Paladin #2:
It's... waiting. Like it owns the place.
Paladin Captain:
Hunters deal with this filth. Get in there.
[COMBAT TUTORIAL: Dispatch the demon. Quick, brutal. Blood spatters the runes.]
SCENE 3 – THE FRACTURE
The MC edges forward, eyeing the circle's weave.
MC:
It's... twisting the threads. Something's wrong.
Paladin #2 (urgent):
Don't—!
His boot crosses the boundary. Reality implodes. Light folds inward, crushing.
A vast presence coils from the void—everywhere, nowhere. A voice echoes, ancient and intimate, like a lover's breath.
Demon Lord:
Ah... so close now.
Visions assault: human wars, pyres, screams. Atrocities bloom like black flowers.
Demon Lord (conversational, probing):
You curse us for the thinning veil.
But your hatred feeds it. Every grudge, every blade... an open door.
(beat)
Demon Lord:
You stand in the doorway and ask who opened it.
The presence surges—curious, not cruel. It settles like mist in his veins.
The MC collapses, world dissolving to black.
SCENE 4 – FOREST AWAKENING
Sun-dappled woods. The MC stirs, skull throbbing, body leaden. A faint red-eyed orb materializes, hovering.
Orb (Demon Lord) (gentle, coaxing):
Easy now... you've danced with quite the storm.
The MC groans, vision swimming.
Orb:
Remember our bargain?
Silence. Weakness claims him.
Orb (amused, patient):
No? It'll return. It always does.
The orb drifts near—then flinches, vanishing as footsteps approach.
SCENE 5 – Nyxella'S CARE (FRAGMENTS OVER DAYS)
Rustling leaves. Nyxella bounds in—horns glinting, wings fluttering like a curious bird. She flops beside him, sniffing the air, then his hair, his skin. Her eyes widen at unseen threads.
Fragment 1 – First Glimpse (Day 1)
Nyxella:
Hiii... Master? Ohhh... you smell like tangled magics! Sad magics, all knotted and... grumpy. Who made them grumpy? That's not nice. Everyone should love each other!
She pokes his chest. Prismatic illusions shimmer from her palms, weaving into his wounds—threads of light untangling, soothing.
MC (rasping, fading):
...Why...?
Nyxella (tilting head, literal):
Because magics want to play. Yours were crying—see?—all twisty and alone. Now they dance! And you are Master's, so I am yours. Better that way.
He blacks out. She hums softly.
Fragment 2 – Berry Feeding (Day 2)
The MC stirs faintly. Nyxella plucks a ruby berry, chews it to mush, then presses it to his lips with gentle insistence—like feeding a fledgling.
Nyxella (bouncing softly):
Hungry mouth? Berry says yum, but tastes like... cloud secrets? Hee! Master tastes like sparkles.
MC (mumbling weakly):
...What...?
Nyxella:
Tiny words! Magic words? Shhh... magics are happy now. Sleep, Master.
Darkness pulls him under.
Fragment 3 – Forest Whispers (Day 2)
Half-lucid haze. Nyxella twirls, sniffing leaves and shadows.
Nyxella:
Wind smells like... old paper and rain? Maybe... haaa... funny wind! Leaves! Why not blue? Silly leaves... green is their secret... shhh...
She plops beside him, nudging gently.
Nyxella:
Master? Words smell like... ideas? Ideas taste funny too...
He drifts away.
Fragment 4 – Magic Weave (Day 3)
Nyxella waves her hands, tracing invisible patterns.
Nyxella:
Ooooh... magic tastes like tingly rainbow-sparkles! Lots of sparkles... heehee... Do you taste sparkles too, Master? Or... Nyxella-only?
She peers close.
Nyxella:
Stick! Small Master? No... too stiff. Needs bounce...
She tosses a twig, giggles.
MC (bare whisper):
...Who...?
Nyxella (flopping protectively):
Nyxella! Always Master's Nyxella... soft... warm... bestest master...
She curls around him. He fades.
SCENE 6 – ESCAPE
The MC wakes alone on the fourth dawn. Nyxella's scent lingers—sweet, infernal. Panic ignites: demon. She nursed him. Up to no good. He staggers up, fleeing into the underbrush without a glance back.
SCENE 7 – KINGDOM GATES
Days grind by. Filthy, hollow-eyed, the MC reaches the gates.
Guard #1:
...Hunter? Gods, no...
Guard #2:
We mourned you in those ruins! Welcome home, lad.
The gates creak open.
Fade to black.
